# 1-Run Six different machine learning algorithms
In this repository, I Run Six different machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Multiple linear regression, KNN, Decision tree, Random forest and ANN on a good dataset:


# 2-Detail:
In this this exercise, you will implement different methods to find the best results. This exercise helps you have a good code for some important algorithms used in machine learning lessons

# 3-Main file
The main file is script1.ipynb

# 4-Dataset:
Here we have three datasets.The first one "train.csv" is used for our training and find scores, the second one "test.csv" is used to predict and the last one "sampleSubmission.csv" is the final output of the program called script1.ipynb

# 5-Prerequisite:
  1) Jupyter notebook
  2) Pandas pakage
  3) Numpy pakage
  4) Matplot pakage
  5) Seaborn package 
  6) scikit-learn package

# 6-No licence
